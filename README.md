In my game I used basic scripts for casual games such as : 
1) "Level system": Only the first level of the game is unlocked for a player at the beginning. The second level is locked and it will open when a player finishes and so on. 
2) "Shop and upgrade": A player can choose any item(a car) and buy it, if he has enough money. After a player buys an item, the interface displays buttons for upgrading this item.
3) "Graphics options": A player can choose quality graphics moving the sliders for better game perfomance.
4) "Stars manager" uses information about the quantity of stars that a player collected when he passed a level. It shows quantity of collected stars on finish menu and under each icon`s level. It also saves the positon of a collected star using star`s ID on each level and this star for a player becomes invisible(false).
5) "Drive car" Every car has some basic information about its attributes. Also it defines whether a player uses a mobile phone or PC.
